#Python-Time-Series-Forcasting /n In this guided project, we'll be taking on the role of a trader on the S&P 500 futures desk. Our goal is to build a successful model to forecast how this index will move based on its past behavior. If we can make successful predictions, we can trade these futures effectively and lucratively.

The data has several potential columns for us to use for forecasting:

* Open: the opening value of the index on that day
* High: the highest value of the index on that day
* Low: the lowest value of the index on that day
* Close: the closing value of the index on that day
* Volume: the total volume of the index traded on that day
* Adj Close: the closing value of the index on that day adjusted for dividends
